## Hi there 🥳

I'm Alla (she/her), a self-taught Data Analyst based in Seattle, USA. 

### About me:

🌟 I've been transitioning into Data Analytics from Marketing and Economics since July 2021. 

📚 Currently, I'm practicing my SQL skills and have started an 8-week SQL challenge that was brought by Danny Ma! You can find my very first challenge [HERE](https://github.com/allazaytseva/8-week-sql-challenge/tree/main/Case%20Study%20%231:%20Danny's%20Diner)

🔎 You can find me on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/allazaytseva)! My goal for the next week is to organize Github and transfer all my projects from Kaggle to here. 

🧕🏻👩🏾🧑🏼 I'm passionate about introducing more women to the world of data, that's why I've been volunteering at [Women In Data](https://www.womenindata.org/)/Seattle Chapter 🌟
