## Hi there ðŸ¥³

I'm Alla, a self-taught Data Analyst based in Seattle, USA. 

I've been transitioning into Data Analytics from Marketing and Economics since July 2021. 

Currently, I'm practicing my SQL skills and have started an 8-week SQL challenge that was brought by Danny Ma! You can find my very first challenge [HERE](https://github.com/allazaytseva/8-week-sql-challenge)

I've done some projects in R on Kaggle
